					<p> Niko is originally from Ozarks of Southwest Missouri. He was born on April 21st, 2016. He was relocated to "The Valley", California at a young age. When he was 9 months old, he once again was relocated but now in the heart of Los Angeles, California. This is when his career really picked up, gaining thousands of followers on Instagram and knowing all the locals in Downtown LA. He now lives a modest lifestyle in Orange County, California. Niko sits at a  hefty 23 pounds but sometimes 25 pounds, depending on the day. </p>

					<p> About Hot Water Farms, Niko's originator:
						"Hot Water Farm is a small family farm located in the beautiful Ozarks of Southwest Missouri.  We are fortunate to have a beautiful piece of land that allows us to do what we love… spend our days with the animals we love!  We have been raising and showing Miniature Horses for over 10 years and have always had a great love for dogs. 

No, we do not have a hot spring on our property -- the name of our farm was born because Lori was always in Hot Water for bringing home a new animal.  It stuck when we got the miniature horses and everyone accused us of washing them in hot water ”to shrink them!" </p>
